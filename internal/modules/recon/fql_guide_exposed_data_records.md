Falcon Query Language (FQL) - Search Recon Exposed-Data Records Guide

Use this guide to build the `filter` parameter for
`falcon_search_recon_exposed_data_records`.

=== ABOUT EXPOSED-DATA RECORDS ===
Exposed-data records are the underlying leaked credential and PII rows associated
with Recon notifications. One notification may have many records. Use
falcon_search_recon_notifications first to find matching notification IDs, then
use this tool to retrieve the detailed credential/PII rows.

=== BASIC SYNTAX ===
field_name:[operator]'value'

=== OPERATORS ===
• = (default): field_name:'value'
• !: field_name:!'value' (not equal)
• >, >=, <, <=: created_date:>'2024-01-01T00:00:00Z'
• ~: field_name:~'partial' (text match — support is per-field, verify live)
• *: field_name:'prefix*' (wildcards — support is per-field, verify live)

=== DATA TYPES ===
• String: 'value'
• Boolean: true/false (no quotes)
• Timestamp: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ' or relative 'now-7d'

=== COMBINING ===
• + = AND: rule.topic:'SA_DOMAIN'+credential_status:'confirmed_active'
• , = OR:  site:'pastebin.com',site:'telegram.org'
• () = GROUPING: (site:'pastebin.com',site:'telegram.org')+created_date:>'now-7d'

=== COMMON PATTERNS ===
• Records for a specific notification: notification_id:'<id>'
• By domain: domain:'example.com'
• By email: email:'user@example.com'
• By credential status: credential_status:'newly_reported'
• From a specific site: site:'stealer_logs'
• Recent records (past 7 days): created_date:>'now-7d'
• By monitoring rule topic: rule.topic:'SA_DOMAIN'
• Full-text search: _all:'example.com'

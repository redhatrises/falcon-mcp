Falcon Query Language (FQL) - Container Image Vulnerabilities Guide

Use this guide to build the `filter` parameter for `falcon_search_images_vulnerabilities`.

=== BASIC SYNTAX ===
property_name:[operator]'value'

=== AVAILABLE OPERATORS ===
• No operator = equals (default)
• ! = not equal to
• > = greater than
• >= = greater than or equal
• < = less than
• <= = less than or equal
• ~ = text match (ignores case, spaces, punctuation)
• * = wildcard matching (not supported on all fields)

=== DATA TYPES & SYNTAX ===
• Strings: 'value' or ['exact_value'] for exact match
• Dates: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ' (UTC format)
• Booleans: true or false (no quotes)
• Numbers: 123 (no quotes)
• Wildcards: 'partial*' or '*partial' or '*partial*'

=== COMBINING CONDITIONS ===
• + = AND condition
• , = OR condition
• ( ) = Group expressions

IMPORTANT: Use + for AND and , for OR — do NOT use the words AND/OR.
Values must be single-quoted.
